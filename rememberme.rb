# Many Special Thanks to:

# (http://lavitascifosa.wixsite.com/grupposkypegames) . . .
#
# for giving me the idea and actual reasons to make this little
# script. They make the most awesome and funny RPGMKR games I've EVER played.
#
# Took about one hour to figure out how to make it and to complete it.
#
# Purpose:
# This script emulates the very idea behind the Undertale's "remembering"
# system, in which the game remembers the actions from the previous game saves.
#
# In this particular case, when a player selects "New Game" from the title
# screen, the script checks out for existing save games.
# If they exist, it extracts one variable (READ_FROM) from the most
# recent save game, and proceeds to copy it inside of WRITE_ON in the
# new game being started.
# This allows the programmer to interact with statistics coming from
# a "parallel dimension" and allows further concepts like shifting,
# time loops Ã  la Steins;Gate and even more disturbing ideas.
#
#==============================================================================

# Modify these two values to adapt them to the variables you mean to use

READ_FROM = 1
WRITE_ON = 2
